if you are reading this, you have found the Community-Version of the Qytrine engine, a fork of SourceTech.
i have made an agreement with the copyright holder and maintainer to SourceTech, to duallicense my derived work.
DM me on Discord (Pauli1505) for more info, or if you want to become a Community-Manager. as a community manager, you will accept and decline
PR's. Rules in PR's to be valid are:
No significant changes to the QVM system! you can add little changes, as long as you are 100% CERTAIN it will still work with Game QVMs.
I do not want the engines to become different engines with different formats, i just want them to go seperate ways, while staying one.
No tampering with Renderers! Only add changes if its an Improvement or added functions from your mod. You can also DM me incase you are having any problems with the engine.
or you are having your own fork of it and want to discuss relicensing or dual-licensing to your own derivative work, also note this project's lineage leads all the way back to
Id-Tech 2, meaning it CAN be complicated.
